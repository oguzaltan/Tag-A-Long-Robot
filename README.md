# Tag-A-Long-Robot (Accompanying Humans and Achieving Designated Tasks with Autonomous Mobile Robots)
This project aims to to implement mobile robots that can participate in swarm behaviour based activities. These autonomous mobile land robots are designed to track a designated human, avoid nearby obstacles by detecting and dodging them, smoothly move on the terrain, via odometry information provided by beacons placed around the implementation zone.
