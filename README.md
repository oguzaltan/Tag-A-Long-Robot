My senior year project in my Bachelorâ€™s study in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department of Bilkent University, supported by the defense industry company ROKETSAN. As a group of five students, we aimed to implement mobile robots that can track a designated human, avoid nearby obstacles by detecting and dodging them, smoothly move on the terrain, via odometry information provided by beacons placed around the implementation zone. These robots are designed to track a moving human and adjust their motion parameters such as speed and direction, concerning the motion of the tracked object. Also, these robots can avoid nearby obstacles by detecting and dodging them, using LIDAR sensors. Main components are the computer vision system, mechanical setup of the robot, control system, object tracking, avoidance simulations, and real-life testing. 

We have designed, simulated, and tested control systems and algorithms for our robot using Gazebo and Robot Operating System (ROS) running on Ubuntu. Therefore, I have gained a basic understanding of Gazebo and ROS. In addition, I have worked on the mechanical and electrical setup of the robot such as the installment of sensors, motors, drivers, and batteries.
