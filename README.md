This project aims to to implement mobile robots that can participate in swarm behaviour based activities. These autonomous mobile land robots are designed to track a designated human, avoid nearby obstacles by detecting and dodging them, smoothly move on the terrain, via odometry information provided by beacons placed around the implementation zone.
